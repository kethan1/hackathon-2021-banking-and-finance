# Community Bank!
Project Goal:
  - Provide an incentive for people to volunteer
    - Do this by providing rewards that are earned when people volunteer
      - People can go to the place where the event is being held, and they can scan a QR Code, which will add the rewards to their account
    - Using the rewards, people can redeem city services and more

Here is a test QR Code to scan:
